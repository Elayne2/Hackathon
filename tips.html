            <li><b>How To Wash Your Thrifted Clothes?</b></li><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash them separately from your daily laundry as germs can spread to several other garments, even at washing machine temperatures.</li>

                <li>Use a short cycle at low temperature, so that you don’t damage the most delicate garments. This way, you will remove most of the dirt before disinfecting them.</li>
                    
                <li>Immerse the second-hand items in a bowl of hot water (not boiling) with a small amount of washing powder and a powder clothes disinfectant. Leave to soak for a few hours.</li>
                    
                <li>Wash them again in the washing machine. Set the sanitisation cycle that removes 99.9% of allergens, such as Allergy Care pro on the Hoover H-WASH 500 washing machine, that has been designed specifically to sanitise fabrics through the intense steam action.</li>
                    
                <li>Use delicate detergents, to prevent further stress for the fabrics. For example, the softener and concentrated laundry detergent from the new Ecological range of Care+Protect are perfects as made with plant-based surfactants and are chemical free.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The most frequently used and effective method is steam: Tumble dryers, irons or steamers (vertical ironing devices) all have ideal steaming functions to sanitise garments, which also remove the last residues of germs and bacteria.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Baking soda, like vinegar, is a household product which can work wonders on stains in and outside of your wardrobe. Hydrogen peroxide is another low-impact liquid which can wipe away blemishes. Even lemons can be used to naturally rid your clothing of unsightly spots!
